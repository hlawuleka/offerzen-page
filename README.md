## How long did this assignment take you and where did you spend your time?

- The evening of Friday, then Monday for polishing up. Overall, it must have taken me about ~ 8 hours.

## What would you do differently or improve in your solution?

1. Use some styled Components
2. Write the App using TypeScript, more just to have fun with data types and all the fancy-juicy TS stuff. For instance, I would have loved to use the `ReadOnlyArray` data type for my table columns since those should be defined once and never really change.
3. I would have definitely made things neater on the css side. One thing I would have done is to define variables for repeating values such as colors.

## Do you have any feedback on this assignment? For example: What did you enjoy? What could be better? Which aspects were unclear?

1. I thoroughly enjoyed writing out the logic around the search filter. I would actually love to chat to you about this in person? I followed an approach I learned in my CS Degree some years ago. Which is based off the abstract approach on generating/writing regular expressions using functions such as CONCAT to create permutations of possible "words", in this instance, possible searchable phrases.

2. I also loved the filtering and all things data manipulation.
